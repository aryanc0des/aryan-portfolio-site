                    <p class="left-p">A builder at heart, a programmer by passion, and someone who genuinely believes that technology should do something, not just look good.
I don’t code just to code. I build to solve, to simplify, and sometimes — to surprise. I love turning random ideas into real things that actually make sense in the real world. Whether it’s a small tool that saves time or a system that fixes chaos, I’m always trying to create something useful.
I believe in learning by building — not waiting to be “ready,” but getting my hands dirty and figuring it out along the way. Most days, you’ll find me deep in code, obsessed with the tiniest details, or staring at the screen like it owes me answers.
I’m still exploring, still learning, and still building — but one thing’s for sure: I’m just getting started;</p>
